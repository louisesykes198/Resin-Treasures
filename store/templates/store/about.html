    Welcome to <strong>Resin Treasures</strong> — a one-woman creative studio where handmade resin art comes to life. Every piece you’ll find here is designed, poured, and polished with care from a small home studio in the UK.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Resin Treasures is a new and growing passion project, built from a love of crafting and a desire to create beautiful, meaningful keepsakes. As a solo maker, I handle everything — from design and production to packing your orders. It’s a true labour of love, and your support means everything.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Why Resin?</h2>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Resin allows for incredible creativity — from shimmering finishes to embedded details like glitter, flowers, or custom colour blends. No two pieces are ever alike, which makes each item from Resin Treasures truly one-of-a-kind.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Looking Ahead</h2>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
    This is just the beginning. I’m always experimenting with new ideas, techniques, and designs — and I love hearing from people who want to bring their own ideas to life. Whether you’re shopping for a gift or treating yourself, I hope you find something that brings you joy.
  </p>

    Thank you for supporting small, handmade business. You’re helping turn a dream into something real — and I couldn’t be more grateful.
