# Wireframes

Wireframes were built during the planning stage to show the structure and layout of Resin Treasures' essential pages. 
These low-fidelity designs assisted in visualising user flow, prioritising critical elements, and ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience throughout the site. 
Each wireframe depicts a key aspect of the application, such as the home page, product listing, product detail view, user profile, Wishlist, basket, checkout, and contact pages. 
The wireframes served as the foundation for creating easy navigation, clear calls-to-action, and a clean, accessible design that appealed to both new and returning customers.
