Each test reflects Resin Treasures’ commitment to clarity, care, and a user experience built on trust._



## 🔒 Debug Off  

The project uses Django’s `DEBUG` setting to manage security between development and production environments.  

- **Local Development:**  
  `DEBUG = True`  
  This makes it easier to test and debug by showing detailed error messages.

  ![image](doc/debug-true.png)

- **Production (Heroku Deployment):**  
  `DEBUG = False`  
  This hides sensitive error details and enables additional security features such as:  
  - Enforcing HTTPS connections  
  - Secure handling of cookies  
  - Protection of user data
 
  ![image](doc/debug-false.png)

This setup ensures the project is both easy to work on locally and safe when deployed live.  

# 🧰 Validators

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

[W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)

## HTML Validation Checks

The following pages were checked with an HTML validator, and no errors were found:

| **Page**               | **Checked with HTML Validator with no errors** |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| base.html              | ✅ Yes                                        |

## Further Testing

To ensure cross-browser compatibility, the website was tested across multiple web browsers, including **Google Chrome**, **Microsoft Edge**, and **Safari**. It was also viewed on a range of devices, such as desktop and laptop computers, as well as mobile devices including the **Samsung Galaxy A12**, **Samsung Galaxy S22**, and **iPhone SE**. Additionally, friends and family members were invited to review the website and its documentation to identify potential bugs or user experience issues.

# Unit Testing


## 🧪 Testing
Unit tests were written using Django’s built-in TestCase class to ensure key functionality works correctly across the application. All tests were run using the command python manage.py test.

### ✅ Tests Overview

**Model Test** – ProjectModelTest
Verifies that a Project instance can be created successfully and that the name field is stored and retrieved correctly.

**Form Test** – CommentFormTest
Checks that the CommentForm accepts valid input and passes form validation, ensuring the comment field works as intended.

**Authentication Test** – UserAuthTest
Confirms that a test user can log in using the login view. It performs a POST request and follows the redirect to ensure a 200 OK status code is returned, indicating a successful login.

**Security Test** – SecurityTest
Verifies that DEBUG is set to False in a production environment. While DEBUG is currently True during local development, conditional logic is in place to enable important security features in production:

if not DEBUG:
    SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
    CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
    ...
else:
    # Local development settings
    SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = False
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False
    CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False
This setup ensures HTTPS and secure cookie settings are applied when the project is deployed.
